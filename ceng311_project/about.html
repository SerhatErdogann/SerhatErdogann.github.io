        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p >Following the devastating earthquake on February 6, university students in Ankara came together to launch the “Toy Inventors” project. 
            Their goal was to bring a little joy to the lives of the affected children and offer them moral support. 
            Leveraging a variety of crafting techniques and materials, the team produced colorful and imaginative toys. 
            This process not only helped the young participants develop their manual skills and enrich their creativity, 
            but also united them in a shared act of social responsibility. Beyond simply providing gifts, each toy was 
            intended to serve as a comforting companion, aiding children in their healing process. In this way, “Toy Inventors” 
            evolved into a movement emphasizing empathy, solidarity, and creativity, all while aiming to make a meaningful impact on the community.</p>
