        <h2>Repkon –  Intern Engineer</h2>
        <p>
            I designed a website using React, Node.js and SQL. I developed a system that is
            subject to the supplier list and authorized users can perform transactions on the
            site.
        </p>
        <p>
            I experienced the importance of teamwork, code readability and proper time management in business life. 
            For the first time, I was involved in a real product development process.
