      <h2>Who Am I</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Engineering student focused on improving myself in software development. I develop
        projects using React, C++, and Java technologies. Currently, I am working on developing the website of
        Ogrencim Olur Musun Akademi. I completed my internship at Repkon, where I gained experience in web
        technologies.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I have had the opportunity to experience the potential outcomes of a professional work
        environment. With a dynamic and solution-oriented approach, I fully dedicate myself to assigned projects,
        striving to be effective both individually and in team collaborations. I am ambitious and persistent in the
        tasks I undertake, which allows me to fully commit to my projects and strive for excellence.
        I enjoy participating in volunteer work, which enables me to meet many people and improve my
        interpersonal skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continuously enhance my technical skills and keep learning new technologies. My goal is to specialize
 further in software development and gain valuable experience through various projects to advance my
 career.
